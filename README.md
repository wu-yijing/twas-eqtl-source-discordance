## Overview

This repository contains analysis scripts and processed data for:

**"eQTL weight-source choice reshapes TWAS gene candidacy: a two-axis dual-source audit with disease-agnostic calibration and a genome-wide benchmark"**

Status: code & data release accompanying the manuscript (BMC Genomics submission).

> **Repository renamed on 2026-09-19** from `TWAS-eQTL-source-confounding` to `twas-eqtl-source-discordance`, to match the terminology adopted in the current manuscript. GitHub redirects the old name; the Zenodo archive, its concept DOI and all earlier release tags are unaffected. Update any existing clone with
> `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:wu-yijing/twas-eqtl-source-discordance.git`.

> The original v1.0.0 release (Zenodo [10.5281/zenodo.21428347](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21428347)) corresponded to the iScience submission titled *"eQTL source confounding systematically biases TWAS cross-population replication …"* (HOTAIR binding proteins, 104 genes, three diabetic complications). The archive now resolves through the concept DOI [10.5281/zenodo.21238202](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21238202), which always points to the latest version; the current version is **v2.7.0** ([10.5281/zenodo.22856712](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22856712), 2026-09-20), which ships the complete finalized figure set (FigS1–FigS6; v2.6.0 carried FigS1 only) alongside the reproducible `figure_scripts_officialZ_20260917/` pipeline, and builds on v2.5.0 (harmonized eQTLGen recompute, the Fig. S4 model-SNP-count panel, and the resolved provenance of the dual-mismatch arm as GTEx multi-tissue Stouffer weighted-Z rather than ACAT-O — ACAT-O is the primary integration method but combines two-sided P values and therefore carries no intrinsic direction, so it serves the direction-free enrichment endpoint, while Stouffer’s weighted Z is the signed estimator behind the dual-mismatch arm (Methods; see Key Findings).

### Core Question

By how much does the choice of eQTL weight source (GTEx v8 tissue-specific vs. eQTLGen large-scale whole blood) perturb the conclusions a TWAS actually reports — Z-score sign, candidate gene rank and FDR gene candidacy — and how much of that perturbation is attributable to the resource/sample-size axis rather than the tissue-context axis?

> **Terminology:** throughout this repository and the current manuscript, *eQTL-source discordance* denotes the systematic perturbation of TWAS gene-candidacy conclusions induced by the weight source when GWAS input and analytic pipeline are held fixed. It is operational and **not** a claim of confounding in the causal sense — the earlier releases of this archive were described with the latter term, which the manuscript no longer uses.

### Figure set and figure scripts (current as of 2026-09-20)

**`figures/`** holds the complete, finalized figure set of the manuscript — **Fig1–Fig8** (main text) and
**FigS1–FigS6** (Additional file 1) — each as `PNG` (600 dpi, RGB) + `PDF` (vector) + a `*_caption.txt`.
All 43 files are **byte-identical** to the submission set; the in-figure numbering follows the manuscript
(no legacy `Figure1–Figure9` scheme). See `figures/README_figure_set.md`.

**`figure_scripts_officialZ_20260917/`** is the **only** pipeline that reproduces those figures: it reads
`data/processed_officialZ/` (official MetaXcan v0.8.1 Z recompute) and Additional file 1's tables.
All paths go through `paths_config.py` — run `python paths_config.py` to print the resolved
input/output paths, and override with `TWAS_REPO` / `TWAS_DATA_Z` / `FIG_OUT_MAIN` / `FIG_OUT_SUPP` /
`AF1_DOCX` / `FIG_RESULTS`. **Additional file 1 is not distributed with this repository** (it is the
journal's supplementary file); download it and point `AF1_DOCX` at it. See that directory's `README.md`.

Three directories are **superseded and kept only for audit** — do not use them to reproduce the paper:

| Directory | Why deprecated |
|---|---|
| `_DEPRECATED_figure_scripts_pre20260917/` | The five data-driven scripts of the 2026-09-14 generation. They read the **pre-correction** data layer `data/processed/` (missing the σᵢ expression-variance factor and with a PLINK 2-bit decoding defect), so they reproduce *retired* values — e.g. RNH1 DR Z = 13.318 vs 2.3064, TUBB = 48.516 vs 11.8932, CKAP4 = 4.7549 vs 0.9874 (×4–×6). |
| `_DEPRECATED_supplementary_old_numbering/` | The pre-2026-09-15 supplementary-figure scheme (`FigureS1–FigureS8`), which does **not** correspond to the current Additional file 1 (Fig. S1–S6). Superseded by `figures/FigS1–FigS6`. |
| `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/` | The **in-house** SCZ TWAS estimator (Z = (w′R⁻¹z)/√(w′R⁻¹w)), renamed from `scz_replication/` on 2026-09-20. Its JSON/CSV results are the pre-correction snapshot (n = 2,511), not the manuscript's values; the current SCZ statistics come from the official MetaXcan v0.8.1 binary. See `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/README_DEPRECATED.md`. |

### Key Findings

> **Provenance and status (table rewritten 2026-09-20).** The values below are the **current manuscript values** (BMC Genomics submission, manuscript dated 2026-09-20), recomputed with the **unmodified official MetaXcan v0.8.1 binary**. `figures/` holds the matching figure set (Fig1–Fig8 + FigS1–FigS6) produced by `figure_scripts_officialZ_20260917/`, and `data/processed_officialZ/_PROVENANCE.json` records the archived inputs. For traceability the superseded v2.5.0 generation is recorded here in one place only — ρ = 0.32, direction consistency 63.5%, RNH1 Z = +13.82 / +13.32, pooled Z = +1.52, SCZ n = 2,511 — and **must not be quoted**; see the two corrections below.

> **Two corrections these numbers rest on.** (i) **Allele harmonization**: all eQTLGen-arm values were recomputed after three-way allele harmonization (eQTLGen assessed/other alleles ↔ FinnGen R13 ref/alt ↔ 1000G EUR A2) against the official eQTLGen FDR < 0.05 weight catalogue; the earlier archived eQTLGen export carried an allele-alignment defect (24.1% of Z-scores flipped sign). (ii) **Estimator correction**: the in-house S-PrediXcan implementation behind v2.5.0 omitted the σᵢ expression-variance factor and mis-decoded the PLINK 2-bit genotype encoding. Both were fixed and every Z-score recomputed with the official MetaXcan v0.8.1 binary; this is what removed the previously reported extreme values (RNH1 DR Z fell from 13.32 to 2.31, TUBB from 48.52 to 11.89, CKAP4 from 4.75 to 0.99).

> **Definitions and denominators.** FDR enrichment rates are Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected **within each group × phenotype × weight-source stratum** and are the proportion of testable genes with q < 0.05, compared between groups by Fisher's exact test. Two eQTLGen gene universes must not be conflated: the **61-gene harmonised arm** (24 candidate, 24 non-candidate, 13 T2DM control), which carries the model-SNP statistics, and the **69-gene denominator universe** (27 candidate, 25 non-candidate, 17 T2DM control; 207 gene–phenotype pairs), which supplies the eQTLGen rates of Table 2 and the per-gene FDR calls of Additional file 1: Tables S17 and S18. Of the 104 testbed genes, 37 have no eQTLGen model in the official FDR < 0.05 catalogue and 67 do, of which 61 return a valid S-PrediXcan statistic (Additional file 1: Table S10). Gene-level Z-scores and the arm denominators are in `data/processed_officialZ/`.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total genes analysed (testbed) | 104 = 30 candidate + 44 non-candidate + 30 T2DM control | One row per gene in the covariate matrix (Additional file 1: Table S1). The three disease-agnostic control **layers** (30 genes each; Table 1a) are a separate set, not a fourth testbed group. |
| Spearman ρ, GTEx Whole_Blood vs eQTLGen (primary arm) | 0.39 (Fisher-z 95% CI 0.21–0.55; naive P = 8.8 × 10⁻⁵) | 96 gene–phenotype pairs from 32 genes. The naive P is anticonservative because pairs cluster within genes; cluster-aware alternatives give SE = 0.125 (two-sided P = 0.004), jackknife SE = 0.137 (P = 0.008) and permutation P < 0.001 (Additional file 1: Table S16). |
| Direction consistency (primary arm) | 68.8% (66/96); gene-cluster bootstrap 95% CI 58.3–79.2% | DR 71.9% (23/32), DN 65.6% (21/32), DPN 68.8% (22/32) (Table 3a). Not separable from the within-arm empirical null (63.6%, 35/55) and 27.9 percentage points below the 96.7% within-source reference (95% CI 17.5–38.4) — a monotone transform of ρ, so the shortfall is reported as a bound, not an effect size. |
| Direction consistency by gene-subset definition (Table 3c) | 67.6% (69/102) / 68.8% (66/96) / 71.1% (113/159) | Both-source anchor set (34 genes, ρ = 0.373) / primary arm (32 genes, ρ = 0.390) / panel-only all-testbed (53 genes, ρ = 0.490). Across the three whole-testbed definitions the rate spans 67.6–71.1% and ρ spans 0.373–0.490; the candidate-only definitions reach 74.6% (47/63, panel-only) and 74.4% (58/78, dual). |
| GTEx FDR enrichment (candidate arm, all phenotypes) | 2.4% (2/84) | GTEx v8 MASHR with multi-tissue ACAT-O integration. Same-source comparators: non-candidates 1.2% (1/81), T2DM controls 1.8% (1/57) — candidates are not enriched above either (Fisher's exact P = 0.24 and 0.61). Per-phenotype candidate rates are 0.0–3.6% (Tables 1b and 2). |
| eQTLGen FDR enrichment (candidate arm, all phenotypes) | 6.2% (5/81) | Non-candidates 0.0% (0/75) and T2DM controls 0.0% (0/51); no significant excess (Fisher's exact P = 0.21 and 0.49). After Mahalanobis matching, 6.2% (5/81) against 0.0% (0/57) in matched controls (P = 0.077); the GTEx arm is indistinguishable (2.4% vs 1.7%; P = 1.00). No group exceeded 7.4%, below the ≥8.0-pp (GTEx) and ≥13.0-pp (eQTLGen) 80%-power boundaries. |
| RNH1 GTEx Z-score (DR, Nerve_Tibial) | +2.67 | S-PrediXcan; DN +1.70, DPN +1.63; ACAT-O multi-tissue q = 0.28, 0.67, 0.62 (none FDR-significant). The only candidate pair reaching \|Z\| ≥ 1.96 in both sources (Additional file 1: Table S17). |
| RNH1 eQTLGen Z-score (DR) | +2.31 | N = 31,684; P = 0.021. Same sign as the GTEx estimate — the source-stable index gene. |
| Cross-cohort heterogeneity (RNH1, DR; FinnGen R13 vs UK Biobank GCST90043640, both eQTLGen weights) | Z scale (primary): pooled +1.51 (SE 0.79; P = 0.056), Q = 1.26, I² = 20.6%, 95% prediction interval −0.33 to +3.36 (spans zero). √N_e-weighted re-merge: +2.39 (P = 0.017), Q = 0.13, I² = 0% | FinnGen Z = +2.31 (N_e = 49,304), UKB Z = +0.72 (N_e = 1,231; 308 cases), both direction-consistent. With k = 2 and an ≈40-fold N_e gap the heterogeneity statistics are convention-dependent (the same weights on the raw Z scale give +2.09, Q = 76.6, I² = 98.7%), so the between-cohort contrast, not Q or I², carries the evidence (Fig. 7; Additional file 1: Table S4). |
| Genome-wide SCZ replication (PGC3 wave3 European) | ρ = 0.469 panel-only / 0.420 tissue-only / 0.447 dual (n = 8,315) | Complete-case **8,315** genes (80.3%) of a **10,357**-gene pool; 9,048 (87.4%) carry a GTEx Whole_Blood model and 8,890 a Z in both GTEx tissues. The plotted tissue-axis estimate uses n = 8,890, the four-arm decomposition n = 8,315, and both give ρ = 0.420 to three decimals. Arm-wise direction consistency 67.2 / 66.8 / 66.2% (pairwise gaps ≤ 1.0 pp); dual-arm discordance 33.8% (Fig. 8; Additional file 1: Table S15). |

## SCZ 2×2 Decomposition Replication (added in v2.0.0)

A dual-source 2×2 decomposition was applied to schizophrenia (SCZ, PGC3 wave3 European, 53,386 cases / 77,258 controls) to test whether the source/panel vs tissue-context structure generalizes beyond the metabolic discovery cohort.

- **Method**: the current SCZ statistics were recomputed with the **official MetaXcan v0.8.1 binary**, holding the eQTL weights, tissues, SNP filters and LD reference identical to the discovery analysis. The four-arm Z matrix is archived as `data/processed_officialZ/scz_z_4arm_official.csv`; the earlier self-implemented estimator (Z = (w′R⁻¹z)/√(w′R⁻¹w), LD from 1000G EUR, ridge 0.1) is retained under `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/` for provenance only.
- **Denominators (two are in use)**: a 10,357-gene pool with a valid model, of which 9,048 (87.4%) carry a GTEx Whole_Blood model and 8,890 a Z in **both** GTEx tissues. The four-arm decomposition requires a finite Z in all four arms and therefore rests on the **8,315-gene complete-case set (80.3% of the pool)**. The plotted tissue-axis estimate uses n = 8,890 and the decomposition n = 8,315; the two subsets agree to three decimals (ρ = 0.420).
- **Results (complete-case n = 8,315)**:
  - Panel-only analogue (eQTLGen vs GTEx Whole_Blood): ρ = **+0.469**, 67.2% direction-consistent
  - Tissue-only analogue (GTEx Whole_Blood vs GTEx Nerve_Tibial): ρ = **+0.420**, 66.8%
  - Dual analogue (eQTLGen vs GTEx multi-tissue): ρ = **+0.447**, 66.2%, reversal rate 33.8% (against 32.8% in the testbed dual arm)
  - The three arms are indistinguishable on direction consistency (every pairwise gap ≤ 1.0 percentage point, against a binomial interval width of ≈±1 point), while on ρ the dual arm lies between the two single-axis arms — the ρ-based axis ordering is **trait-dependent**, not a fixed “source always dominates” rule.
  - Formal axis contrast: Δρ(dual − tissue) = +0.0265 (95% CI +0.0002 to +0.0524; bootstrap P = 0.048) and Δρ(dual − panel) = −0.0226 (95% CI −0.0355 to −0.0094; P = 0.0006). Measured against the post hoc 0.10 margin the axes are reported as **indistinguishable at this sample size**, not as equivalent (the margin is 3.8× the observed difference).
- **Sparsity**: GTEx v8 MASHR models are sparse (median 2 model SNPs per gene, IQR 1–2) whereas the eQTLGen cis panel is dense, and the tissue-axis contrast is not framework-dependent (ρ = 0.525 under elastic net vs 0.499 under MASHR on the 4,098-gene four-way universe). Stratifying the SCZ contrast by GTEx model size does not establish sparsity as a sufficient explanation of the tissue axis (tissue-only minus dual, +0.54 percentage points, 95% CI −0.79 to +1.86, P = 0.43; Additional file 1: Table S15).
- **⚠️ Archive note**: the JSONs in `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/results/` are the **earlier self-implemented-pipeline snapshot** (n = 2,511 complete-case; ρ = 0.522 for the source analogue and 0.509 for the tissue axis) and do **not** carry the current values — they are kept for provenance only. Authoritative current values: `data/processed_officialZ/scz_z_4arm_official.csv` together with Additional file 1 (Tables S15 and S16).
- **Scripts** (all superseded — kept for audit): `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/scz_twas.py` (in-house TWAS + decomposition), `build_weights_db.py` (weight DB), `robustness_scz.py` (sparsity-stratified robustness), `scz_axis_difference_analysis.py` + `scz_threshold_calibration.py`, and the iScience-era figure scripts `make_figure9_scz.py` / `make_robustness_fig.py`.
- **Figures**: the SCZ arm is not part of the current figure set (`figures/`). The two SCZ figure scripts (`make_figure9_scz.py`, `make_robustness_fig.py`) are iScience-era leftovers that write to `submission_iScience_v2/figures/` and `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/_rdat_tmp/` — neither path is tracked here. The machine-readable SCZ results of the current manuscript are in `data/processed_officialZ/scz_z_4arm_official.csv`; the superseded snapshot is in `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/results/`.

## Quick Start (Docker — Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Build the Docker image
docker build -t twas-eqtl-repro .

# 2. Run the full reproducibility pipeline
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output twas-eqtl-repro

# 3. View outputs
open output/figs/    # All figures in PDF + PNG
open output/logs/    # Analysis provenance logs
```

> ⚠️ **What the container actually runs.** `run_all.sh` executes the **early-generation** downstream scripts in `scripts/python/` (they write `figs/`, which is then copied to `output/`). The container therefore reproduces the environment and that earlier pipeline — **not** the current figure set. To regenerate `figures/` use `figure_scripts_officialZ_20260917/`; its step 00 needs Additional file 1 (the journal supplementary file, not distributed here), so it cannot run in the container without you supplying that file.

### What the Docker image contains
- **Python 3.13 + R 4.5.2** with all dependencies (pandas, scipy, statsmodels, MatchIt, etc.)
- **MetaXcan** (for S-PrediXcan, run separately with `run_spredixcan.sh`)
- **Downstream analysis scripts** that generate all paper figures
- **Processed data** needed to reproduce figures from intermediate results

## Local Setup (Conda)

```bash
# With your local conda installation:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate twas-eqtl

# Run downstream analysis
python scripts/python/04_generate_all_figures.py
```

## Reproducing the Full Pipeline (Optional)

To reproduce from raw GWAS data (requires large input files):

```bash
# Mount external data and run S-PrediXcan
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/finngen_data:/input/finngen \
  -v /path/to/gtex_models:/input/gtex \
  -v /path/to/eqtlgen_weights:/input/eqtlgen \
  -v /path/to/1000g_ref:/input/1000g \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \
  twas-eqtl-repro \
  bash /app/run_spredixcan.sh
```

**Which part is current.** The paper's figures are `figures/`, and the only pipeline that reproduces
them is `figure_scripts_officialZ_20260917/` (start with `python paths_config.py`, which prints every
input and output path). The Z-scores, denominators and cross-cohort values are authoritative in
`data/processed_officialZ/`. Older generations are kept for provenance and marked
`_DEPRECATED_…`, `scripts/python/` (early-generation figure pipeline), `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/` (in-house SCZ TWAS estimator) or `data/processed/`
(pre-correction intermediates) — none of them should be used to reproduce the paper.
A directory named `figs/` is **not** part of the repository: `run_all.sh` creates it at run time as
its figure output, then copies it (with logs and processed data) into `output/`. `docs/`,
`manuscript/` and `figures/scz/`, which earlier versions of this README listed, do not exist.

## SCZ Replication Folder Layout
The genome-wide SCZ arm’s code is **superseded and kept only for audit**, like the other
`_DEPRECATED_*` directories. It implements the **in-house** TWAS estimator
(`Z = (w′R⁻¹z)/√(w′R⁻¹w)`), whereas the current manuscript recomputes the SCZ statistics with the
official MetaXcan v0.8.1 binary. See `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/README_DEPRECATED.md`.

## Cluster-Robustness Re-analysis of Direction Consistency (S1)

> ⚠️ **Status (2026-09-20): this section has been rebuilt onto the corrected Z layer.** The
> v2.5.0-generation run it previously described read `data/processed/` (pre-correction) and was
> written against an older manuscript draft; its numbers are recorded in the traceability note at
> the end of this section. The values below are the manuscript’s — Additional file 1: Table S16 for
> the cluster-aware procedures and Table 3a for the arm rates.

The primary between-source comparison comprises 96 gene–phenotype pairs that derive from only
**32 genes** (three phenotypes each), so the pairs are not independent observations. All four
cluster-aware procedures reported by the manuscript are computed on the rank correlation
(ρ = 0.39 on the 96 pairs):

| Procedure | Value |
|---|---|
| Naive t test on the rank correlation | t = 4.10 (df 94), P = 8.8 × 10⁻⁵ |
| Cluster-robust sandwich standard error | SE = 0.125 — one-sided P = 0.002 (two-sided P = 0.004, df 31) |
| Delete-one-gene jackknife standard error | SE = 0.137 — one-sided P = 0.004 (two-sided P = 0.008, df 31) |
| Gene-label permutation (B = 10,000) | null 2.5–97.5 percentiles −0.22 to 0.23; P < 0.001 |
| Gene-level cluster bootstrap (B = 10,000) | ρ 95% CI 0.12–0.62; direction consistency 95% CI 58.3–79.2% |

Resampling detail: all four resampling procedures use B = 10,000 draws with **seed 20260915** (Additional file 1: Table S16, note). The seeds recorded in the traceability note below belong to the superseded generation.

All four procedures keep the association significant, so the independent-pair naive test is not
materially anti-conservative. The manuscript nevertheless reports the **gene-cluster bootstrap
interval as the primary interval** for the direction-consistency rate (58.3–79.2%) rather than the
independent-pair Clopper–Pearson interval (58.5–77.8%; Additional file 1: Table S20, min|Z| = 0),
and reports the rate descriptively, because it is not separable from the within-arm empirical null
(63.6%, 35/55).

**Repo-level diagnostic — not reported in the manuscript.** Recomputing the one-way ICC of the
per-gene concordance proportions on the current primary arm
(`data/processed_officialZ/primary_arm_96pairs_official.csv`; 32 genes × 3 pairs) gives
**ICC = 0.000** — the raw estimate is −0.004 before clipping at zero, i.e. between-gene variance
does not exceed within-gene variance — and **design effect = 1.000**. Clustering of the binary
concordance outcome within genes is therefore negligible. This is the same diagnostic the earlier
generation reported, recomputed on the corrected Z layer; it is offered for reproducibility and is
not part of the manuscript’s evidence.

**Genome-wide SCZ arm.** With a single trait each gene contributes **exactly one comparison**
(8,315 complete-case genes drawn from a 10,357-gene pool), so the design effect is 1 by construction
and no cluster correction is required. The current arm correlations are ρ = +0.469 (panel-only),
+0.420 (tissue-only) and +0.447 (dual), with direction consistency 67.2 / 66.8 / 66.2%.

> ⚠️ **Superseded numbers, recorded for traceability only — do not quote.** The v2.5.0-generation
> run reported 61/96 = 63.5%, a naive exact binomial test of P = 0.010, ICC = 0.000 / design
> effect = 1.000, sandwich P = 0.013, gene-level bootstrap P = 0.017 (95% CI 53.1–74.0%) and
> permutation P = 0.008, at B = 10,000 with seeds `20260910` (HOTAIR arms) and `20260726` (SCZ arm);
> for SCZ it reported 2,511 pairs from 2,511 genes with 68.26% / ρ = 0.522 and 71.21% / ρ = 0.509.
> The current manuscript reports no exact binomial test against 50% for this arm and no ICC or
> design-effect statement. `scripts/python/s1_cluster_robustness/` — including its `README.md` and
> `s1_results.json` — still describes that generation; treat it as provenance for the deprecated
> pipeline rather than as the current analysis.

## Reproducibility

The authoritative processed data tables are in `data/processed_officialZ/` (Z-scores, arm denominators, the four-arm SCZ matrix); the earlier `data/processed/` layer is retained only as pre-correction provenance, and the superseded SCZ snapshot sits in `_DEPRECATED_scz_self_implemented/results/`. Analysis scripts are version-controlled in this repository under MIT license. The repository snapshot is archived at Zenodo under the concept DOI [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21238202](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21238202), which always resolves to the latest version (current version **v2.7.0**, [10.5281/zenodo.22856712](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22856712)). The gene-level cluster-robustness re-analysis (S1) is archived here (`scripts/python/s1_cluster_robustness/`, which documents the **superseded** v2.5.0-generation run — see the S1 section); it is **not** bundled as a separate archive in the Zenodo release (v2.7.0 ships `figures/`, `tables/`, `figure_scripts/` and `split_half_simulation/`). The sqrt(N_e)-weighted sensitivity re-merge of the RNH1 DR cross-cohort meta-analysis (M6(b)) and the descriptive three-study merge re-including GCST90043640 (M6(d)) are reproducible via `scripts/python/m6_ne_weighted_sensitivity.py` (output: `data/processed/m6_ne_weighted_sensitivity_results.txt`); the per-gene eQTLGen Z, BH q and FDR calls underlying the group rows of Tables 1b and 2 are provided in `data/processed_officialZ/eqtlgen_official_Z.csv` (`BH_q` and `FDR_significant`; 96 genes × 3 phenotypes = 288 rows).

> ⚠️ `data/processed/eqtlgen_vs_gtex_comparison.csv` is **superseded for direction-consistency analyses**: it predates the three-way allele harmonisation, so its `Same_Direction` column reflects pre-harmonisation Z-scores. Use `data/processed_officialZ/eqtlgen_official_Z.csv` instead.
