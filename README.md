## Overview

This repository contains analysis scripts and processed data for:

**"Conventional TWAS endpoints cannot quantify the effect of eQTL weight-source choice on gene candidacy: a two-axis dual-source audit with disease-agnostic calibration and a genome-wide benchmark"**

Status: code & data release accompanying the manuscript (BMC Genomics submission).

> **Repository renamed on 2026-09-19** from `TWAS-eQTL-source-confounding` to `twas-eqtl-source-discordance`, to match the terminology adopted in the current manuscript. GitHub redirects the old name; the Zenodo archive, its concept DOI and all earlier release tags are unaffected. Update any existing clone with
> `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:wu-yijing/twas-eqtl-source-discordance.git`.

> The original v1.0.0 release (Zenodo [10.5281/zenodo.21428347](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21428347)) corresponded to the iScience submission titled *"eQTL source confounding systematically biases TWAS cross-population replication …"* (HOTAIR binding proteins, 104 genes, three diabetic complications). The archive now resolves through the concept DOI [10.5281/zenodo.21238202](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21238202), which always points to the latest version; the current version is v2.5.0 ([10.5281/zenodo.22752073](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22752073)), which adds the harmonized eQTLGen recompute (three-way allele harmonization), the Fig. S4 model-SNP-count panel on that recompute, and the resolved provenance of the dual-mismatch arm (GTEx multi-tissue Stouffer weighted-Z, not ACAT-O).

### Core Question

By how much does the choice of eQTL weight source (GTEx v8 tissue-specific vs. eQTLGen large-scale whole blood) perturb the conclusions a TWAS actually reports — Z-score sign, candidate gene rank and FDR gene candidacy — and how much of that perturbation is attributable to the resource/sample-size axis rather than the tissue-context axis?

> **Terminology:** throughout this repository and the current manuscript, *eQTL-source discordance* denotes the systematic perturbation of TWAS gene-candidacy conclusions induced by the weight source when GWAS input and analytic pipeline are held fixed. It is operational and **not** a claim of confounding in the causal sense — the earlier releases of this archive were described with the latter term, which the manuscript no longer uses.

### Key Findings

> ⚠️ **Version note (2026-09-19).** The headline numbers in the table below predate the official-MetaXcan Z recompute now archived here (`data/processed_officialZ/`, added 2026-09-19). They describe the **v2.5.0 generation**; the recomputed figures for the current manuscript will be folded in with the next release. Until then treat `data/processed_officialZ/_PROVENANCE.json` and the files it records as authoritative for Z-scores, direction consistency and cross-cohort heterogeneity.

> **Note (2026-09-09, harmonized recompute):** The table below reflects the **current manuscript version (BMC Genomics submission)**, in which all eQTLGen-arm values were recomputed after **three-way allele harmonization** (eQTLGen assessed/other alleles ↔ FinnGen R13 ref/alt ↔ 1000G EUR A2) using the official eQTLGen FDR < 0.05 weight catalogue. This supersedes both the v1.0.0 (iScience) pipeline values and the earlier archived eQTLGen export, which contained an allele-alignment defect (24.1% of Z-scores flipped sign after harmonization). FDR enrichment rates are computed by Benjamini–Hochberg correction within each group × phenotype × source stratum; 37 of the 104 testbed genes have no eQTLGen model in the official FDR < 0.05 catalogue and are disclosed in the manuscript Methods; of the 67 that do, 61 return a valid S-PrediXcan statistic and form the eQTLGen arm (Additional file 1: Table S10). See `data/processed/eqtlgen_spredixcan_harmonized_results.csv` (gene-level Z-scores) and `data/processed/enrichment_comparison_harmonized.csv` (stratum-wise enrichment rates with Clopper–Pearson CIs).

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total genes analyzed | 104 (30 candidate + 44 non-candidate + 30 T2DM control) | 104 records in covariate matrix (one row per gene) |
| Spearman ρ (GTEx WB vs harmonized eQTLGen Z-scores) | 0.32 (P = 0.001) | 96 gene–phenotype pairs from 32 genes (primary arm) |
| Direction consistency (primary arm) | 63.5% (61/96) | Exact binomial P = 0.010 vs 50%; DR 65.6%, DN 65.6%, DPN 59.4% |
| Direction consistency by gene-subset definition (manuscript Table 3c) | 62.7% (64/102) / 63.5% (61/96) / 69.9% (109/156) | both-source anchor set (34 genes) / primary arm (32 genes) / full testbed (52 genes); subset definitions shift estimates by ≤7 pp |
| GTEx FDR rate (candidate, DR) | 48.1% (13/27) | GTEx v8 MASHR, multi-tissue Stouffer integration |
| eQTLGen FDR rate (candidate, DR) | 41.7% (10/24) | Harmonized recompute; group rates 41.7–66.7% across phenotypes, comparable to non-candidate and T2DM controls |
| RNH1 GTEx Z-score (DR, Nerve_Tibial) | +13.82 | S-PrediXcan; from sparse 3-SNP MASHR model |
| RNH1 eQTLGen Z-score (DR) | +13.32 | Harmonized recompute; source-stable signal |
| Cross-cohort heterogeneity (RNH1, DR; FinnGen R13 vs UKB GCST90043640, both eQTLGen weights) | I² = 20.5% | Random-effects pooled Z = +1.52 (SE 0.79; P = 0.056), 95% prediction interval −0.33 to +3.36 (spans zero). Both cohorts direction-consistent (+2.31 and +0.72). Computed with the unmodified official MetaXcan v0.8.1 binary; √N_e-weighted re-merge gives Z = +2.39, Q = 0.13, I² = 0%. The former second cohort `ieu-b-4803` was withdrawn on 2026-09-16 (accession not resolvable in IEU OpenGWAS). |
| SCZ replication (n=2,511 pairs) | 68.3% direction consistency | Axis difference not significant (bootstrap P = 0.530) |

## SCZ 2×2 Decomposition Replication (added in v2.0.0)

A dual-source 2×2 decomposition was applied to schizophrenia (SCZ, PGC3 wave3 European) to test whether the source/panel vs tissue-context structure generalizes beyond the metabolic discovery cohort.

- **Method**: self-implemented TWAS Z = (w′R⁻¹z)/√(w′R⁻¹w) with LD from 1000G EUR, ridge RIDGE=0.1; 2×2 axes = source (eQTLGen Whole_Blood vs GTEx multi-tissue Stouffer) and tissue (GTEx Whole_Blood vs GTEx Nerve_Tibial).
- **Results (n = 2,511 gene–tissue pairs)**:
  - Source axis ρ = +0.522 (68.3% direction concordance)
  - Tissue axis ρ = +0.509 (71.2% direction concordance)
  - Both axes positive and comparable in magnitude — the axis ordering is **trait-dependent**, not a fixed "source always dominates" rule.
- **Sparsity robustness**: GTEx v8 MASHR models are sparse (median 2 SNPs/gene). Stratifying by model size (2 / 3–4 / ≥5 SNPs) gave stable ρ (≈0.5 across strata) with bootstrap 95% CI excluding zero; the eQTLGen side (median 786 SNPs/gene) anchors the source axis. See `scz_replication/results/`.
- **Scripts**: `scz_replication/scz_twas.py` (TWAS + decomposition), `scz_replication/build_weights_db.py` (weight DB), `scz_replication/robustness_scz.py` (stratified robustness), `scz_replication/make_figure9_scz.py` + `scz_replication/make_robustness_fig.py` (figures).
- **Figures**: `figures/scz/Fig9_2x2_decomposition.*` (source/tissue scatter) and `figures/scz/FigS1_sparsity_robustness.*` (stratified robustness).

## Quick Start (Docker — Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Build the Docker image
docker build -t twas-eqtl-repro .

## Cluster-Robustness Re-analysis of Direction Consistency (S1)

The primary between-source comparison comprises 96 gene–phenotype pairs that derive from
only **32 genes**, so a gene's three phenotypes (DR, DN, DPN) are not independent
observations. The `scripts/python/s1_cluster_robustness/` folder quantifies this clustering
and recomputes the direction-consistency test with three cluster-aware procedures.

**Result: the intra-gene correlation is negligible (ICC = 0.000, design effect = 1.000).**
The exact binomial test reported in the manuscript (P = 0.010) is therefore **not materially
anti-conservative** — a cluster-robust sandwich test gives P = 0.013, a gene-level cluster
bootstrap gives P = 0.017 (95% CI 53.1–74.0%), and a gene-label permutation test gives
P = 0.008. All variants remain significant at α = 0.05, and the CI widens by only 0.9
percentage points (53.1–74.0% vs 53.1–73.1%).

For the genome-wide SCZ arm the complete-case set contributes **exactly one pair per gene**
(2,511 pairs from 2,511 genes), so the design effect is 1 by construction and no cluster
correction is required; the gene-resampling bootstrap coincides with the exact binomial test
(68.26%, ρ = 0.522 for the resource/sample-size axis; 71.21%, ρ = 0.509 for the
tissue-context axis).

Seeds: `20260910` (HOTAIR arms) and `20260726` (SCZ arm), B = 10,000 each.
Full methods, reproduction steps and a stale-file caveat are in
`scripts/python/s1_cluster_robustness/README.md`.

## Reproducibility

All processed data tables are provided in `data/processed/` and `scz_replication/results/`. Analysis scripts are version-controlled in this repository under MIT license. The repository snapshot is archived at Zenodo under the concept DOI [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21238202](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21238202), which always resolves to the latest version (current version v2.4.0, [10.5281/zenodo.22691102](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22691102)). The gene-level cluster-robustness re-analysis (S1) is archived both here (`scripts/python/s1_cluster_robustness/`) and in that Zenodo release as `s1_cluster_robustness.zip`. The sqrt(N_e)-weighted sensitivity re-merge of the RNH1 DR cross-cohort meta-analysis (M6(b)) and the descriptive three-study merge re-including GCST90043640 (M6(d)) are reproducible via `scripts/python/m6_ne_weighted_sensitivity.py` (output: `data/processed/m6_ne_weighted_sensitivity_results.txt`); the per-gene eQTLGen BH-FDR values underlying the DR rows of Table 1 are provided in `data/processed/eqtlgen_DR_pergene_FDR.csv`.

> ⚠️ `data/processed/eqtlgen_vs_gtex_comparison.csv` is **superseded for direction-consistency analyses**: it predates the three-way allele harmonisation, so its `Same_Direction` column reflects pre-harmonisation Z-scores. Use `data/processed/eqtlgen_spredixcan_harmonized_results.csv` instead.
